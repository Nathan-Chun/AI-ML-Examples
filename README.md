# AI-Demonstrations
Demonstrative Jupyter notebooks of various types of neural networks.  A dedicated GPU is strongly recommended for running these notebooks to prevent excessive runtimes.

Img_Res_Autoencoder: 
- Autoencoder that converts 64x64 px images to 256x256 px images.  

DDPM_with_CNN_Classifier:
- A CNN classifier is used to classify fake images produced by a diffusion model.
- Requires downloading EMNIST dataset (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05373).
